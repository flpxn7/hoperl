# hoperl
This is a run-through of exercises from Higher-Order Perl, by Mark Jason Dominus, located online at http://hop.perl.plover.com/.

The book was originally published in 2005, and some source code is available elsewhere, but I decided to work through most of the code here.

# why do it?
This run-through scratched a number of professional itches, including:
* Working with Git on a daily basis
* Working with Emacs on a daily basis
* Working with a language I know on a daily basis, in a more functional context

Most of the code here is being pushed into git from a Linux cloud server, using command-line tools only and Emacs, together with the emacs.d file found here: https://github.com/purcell

So the reason why is that, since becoming a manager, I don't code enough, and this allows me to keep up skills that I wouldn't have otherwise.
