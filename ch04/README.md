#Chapter 4: Iterators

This contains the beginnings of a Perl module to hold integral parts of the iteration which most of the code examples will use.

Note that rand1 and make_rand are both random number generators, but rand1 will always spit out the same sequence of numbers, whereas the iterator used in make_rand will generate a different set of numbers each time.
